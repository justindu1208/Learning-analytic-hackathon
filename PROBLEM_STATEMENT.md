# 🎯 Hackathon Problem Statement

Learning analytics is about understanding how students learn by looking at data from systems like digital education or assessment platforms. Every time you watch a lecture, take a quiz, or post in a forum, that leaves a (digital) trace.  

Learning analytics turns those traces into insight, not to judge or rank you, but to better understand how students engage, what works, and where support might be needed. It's like feedback, not just for you, but to improve teaching, learning, and the overall student experience.  

It helps us answer questions like:
- Which resources do students keep coming back to?  
- What patterns of activity might show someone needs support?  
- How can teaching teams tailor their approach to diverse learning styles?  

In this hackathon, you are invited to explore digital education platform data and develop analyses, models, or solutions that directly benefit students like yourself or empower staff members to better understand learners. By doing so, you will help amplify the student voice and shape how learning analytics is designed and used across Imperial.  

This is your chance to combine creativity, technical skills, and lived experience to co-create meaningful, student-centred innovation. The data is real, the challenges are real, and the potential impact is huge.

## 💡 Example Project Ideas

**You are encouraged to come up with your own project ideas, but here are some for inspiration:**

---

### 1. Discovering Student Learning Styles  
**Problem:** Do students demonstrate distinct patterns of engagement (e.g. “crammers”, “steady learners”, “skimmers”)?  
**Techniques:** Clustering (k-means, hierarchical clustering, DBSCAN), sequence analysis.  
**Impact:** Facilitates tailored teaching approaches, personalised learning, and peer-to-peer connections based on learning behaviours.  

---

### 2. Dashboard to Monitor Own Online Learning Behaviour  
**Problem:** I want a tool/dashboard to monitor my own online learning behaviour and alert me to changes in my usual engagement patterns, and optionally compare with my cohort.  
**Techniques:** UX/UI design, engagement metrics, pattern recognition.  
**Impact:** Helps students become aware of shifts in learning behaviour, reflect on habits, and improve study strategies.

### 3. Online Resource Effectiveness  
**Problem:** Which videos, readings, or quizzes are interacted with by the majority of students in a cohort, and is their use related to end-of-module marks?  
**Techniques:** Engagement metrics, ranking models, correlation analysis.  
**Impact:** Highlights to teaching staff which resources are most useful and whether interactions with them are linked to success.  

---

### 4. Predicting Student Disengagement Risk  
**Problem:** Can we forecast which students are likely to disengage from digital education platforms?  
**Techniques:** Classification (logistic regression, random forest, XGBoost), time-series forecasting, survival analysis.  
**Impact:** Enables informed, supportive conversations between staff and students about study strategies and early interventions.
